# North Carolina Map Assessment Guide

This guide provides a way for data journalists, reform groups, and citizens to compare and assess proposed maps quantitatively. You can follow along the example with the supplied maps from 2019 or upload your own maps to compare. 

You can view the interactive version of the main notebook [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rawitner/NC_redistricting/1b3bd765cd9955f66c5da9ef04b013c0bc00915d).
